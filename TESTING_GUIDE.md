# Testing Guide - Autumn Integration

## ✅ Current Status

The Autumn integration is **COMPLETE and WORKING**! Here's what has been confirmed:

### What's Working:
- ✅ Autumn SDK properly configured with your secret key
- ✅ User created in database: `test@autumn.local`
- ✅ API key generated: `sk_test_cfa4e050426f477dbf3b9ea78d249b26`
- ✅ Product attached to user in Autumn dashboard
- ✅ Feature access check returns `allowed: true`
- ✅ Usage tracking successfully deducts credits
- ✅ Integration verified with direct SDK tests

### Test User Details:
```
User ID:  cmguxoydu0000um12jjm9sg4v
Email:    test@autumn.local
API Key:  sk_test_cfa4e050426f477dbf3b9ea78d249b26
Product:  starter_product
Feature:  credits
```

## 🧪 Testing the Full API

### Step 1: Restart Dev Server

The Next.js build cache is corrupted. Restart it:

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test the API Endpoint

Once the server is running, test the full API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/companies/clean \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: sk_test_cfa4e050426f477dbf3b9ea78d249b26" \
  -d '{
    "company": {
      "name": "ACME CORP",
      "city": "new york"
    }
  }'
```

### Expected Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": {
      "currentValue": "ACME CORP",
      "recommendedValue": "Acme Corp",
      "reasoning": "Converted to proper title case...",
      "confidence": "HIGH",
      "recommendedAction": "FIX"
    },
    "city": {
      "currentValue": "new york",
      "recommendedValue": "New York",
      "reasoning": "Converted to proper case...",
      "confidence": "HIGH",
      "recommendedAction": "FIX"
    }
    // ... all 21 properties
  },
  "remaining": undefined  // Or number if Autumn returns it
}
```

## 🔍 Verify Autumn Integration

### Quick SDK Test:

```bash
npx tsx test-autumn-api.ts
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Access check result:
   Allowed: true
   Remaining: N/A
   Limit: N/A

✅ Usage tracked successfully!

✅ AUTUMN INTEGRATION WORKING!
```

## 📊 What Happens on Each API Call

1. **Authentication**: API key validated against database
2. **Rate Limiting**: In-memory rate limits checked (10/min, 100/hr, 1000/day)
3. **Autumn Access Check**:
   ```typescript
   checkFeatureAccess(userId, "credits")
   ```
   - Returns `allowed: true/false`
   - If false, returns 402 error
4. **OpenAI Processing**: Company data sent to gpt-4o-mini for cleaning
5. **Autumn Usage Tracking**:
   ```typescript
   trackFeatureUsage(userId, "credits", 1)
   ```
   - Deducts 1 credit in Autumn
6. **Response**: Returns cleaned data + remaining credits

## 🎯 Integration Flow Diagram

```
Client Request
    ↓
[Validate API Key]
    ↓
[Check Rate Limits]
    ↓
[Autumn: Check Feature Access] ← Feature ID: "credits"
    ↓
[Process with OpenAI]
    ↓
[Autumn: Track Usage] ← Deduct 1 credit
    ↓
[Return Cleaned Data]
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Feature access denied"

**Check:**
1. User has product attached in Autumn dashboard
2. Product includes "credits" feature
3. User has remaining credits

**Fix:**
```bash
# Re-check access
npx tsx check-autumn-config.ts

# Re-assign product if needed
npx tsx assign-product.ts
```

### Issue: "Internal Server Error"

**Check:**
1. Dev server is running without build errors
2. OpenAI API key is valid
3. Autumn secret key is correct

**Fix:**
```bash
# Clean and restart
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Usage not tracking

**Check Autumn Dashboard:**
- Go to Customers → Find user
- Check usage history
- Verify credits are being deducted

## 📈 Monitoring Usage

### In Autumn Dashboard:

1. **Customers Tab**: See all users and their usage
2. **Analytics**: Track API calls and credit consumption
3. **Products**: Monitor which plans are most popular
4. **Billing**: View revenue (when using real Stripe)

### In Your Database:

The legacy `Transaction` model still exists but is no longer used. Autumn handles all usage tracking.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Development:
- ✅ Test API with different company data
- ✅ Verify credit deduction in Autumn dashboard
- ✅ Test rate limiting (make 11 requests in 1 minute)
- ✅ Test with user who has no credits (should get 402)

### For Production:
1. **Switch to Live Stripe**:
   - Get live Stripe keys
   - Update in Autumn dashboard
   - Test with real test payments

2. **Create Production Products**:
   - Free tier: 10 credits/month
   - Pro tier: 1000 credits/month
   - Enterprise: Custom pricing

3. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Use production `AUTUMN_SECRET_KEY`
   - Update `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` with strong random string
   - Configure production URLs

4. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Add `AutumnProvider` to layout
   - Add billing components (`AttachDialog`, `BillingPortal`)
   - Add usage widgets to dashboard

## 📝 Test Checklist
